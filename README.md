# cardFlipDemo
Quick pure css card flip example.

This was spun out of a client request to have some UX cards flip over when the user hovers/taps across them (originally 8, 4 shown here).  

This is a small, simple demonstration that draws from multiple prior art examples and is designed to showcase the power of pure CSS.  Cards take up all available space within their row.

It should work in most modern browsers, but it is small and simple enough for you to hotfix specific device/browser support should you need.
